# SimCLR for MODIS data set (version 1.0)

## Runnng
Please put the modis .h5 dataset into the `./experiment/datasets/` path and use the `train_modis.ipynb` to monitor the training process.

## Reference
This program is highly based on following repositories and papers. Actually we used most of the codes in 'SupContrast'(https://github.com/HobbitLong/SupContrast) and the we write our own 
dataloader and augmentation modules based on the codes in 'ssl-sky-surveys'(https://github.com/MustafaMustafa/ssl-sky-surveys).
